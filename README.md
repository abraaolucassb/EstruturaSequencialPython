## What Is It?

This repository aims to explore issues involving Sequential Frameworks in Python. The goal is to improve your skills as a Python Developer, and even be an introduction to your career as a programmer.

The real goal of all this is to get me to hone my Python skills, and that in addition, I can help other people as well.

The issues will be resolved here for you to check, remembering that I will do it my way, you can do it your way if you want. Don't get hung up on my code.

## Getting Started

Here are the exercises, let's get to work!

### Exercises

1. Make a program that shows the message "Hello World!" on the screen.

2. Make a program that asks for a number and then shows the message The number entered was [number].

3. Make a program that asks for two numbers and prints the sum.

4. Make a Program that asks for the 4 bimonthly grades and shows the average.

5. Make a program that converts meters to centimeters.

6. Make a program that asks for the radius of a circle, calculate and show its area.

7. Make a program that calculates the area of a square, then show twice this area to the user.

8. Create a program that asks you how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and display your total salary for the month.

9. Make a program that asks for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, transforms it and displays the temperature in degrees Celsius.
C = 5 * ((F-32) / 9).

10. Make a program that asks for the temperature in degrees Celsius, transforms it and displays it in degrees Fahrenheit.

11. Make a program that asks for 2 integers and a real number. Calculate and show:
  
    a. the product of twice the first and half the second;
    
    b. the sum of the triple of the first and the third;
    
    c. the third raised to the cube.

12. Given a person's height as input data, build an algorithm that calculates their ideal weight, using the following formula: (72.7*height) - 58.

13. Given a person's height (h) as input data, build an algorithm that calculates their ideal weight, using the following formulas:
  
    a. For men: (72.7*h) - 58;
  
    b. For women: (62.1*h) - 44.7 .

14. Jo達o Papo-de-Pescador, a good man, bought a microcomputer to monitor his daily work output. Every time he brings in more fish than the weight established by S達o Paulo state fishing regulations (50 kilos), he has to pay a fine of R$4.00 per kilo. Jo達o needs you to make a program that reads the variable peso (weight of fish) and calculates the excess. Store the number of kilos over the limit in the excess variable and the amount of the fine that John must pay in the fine variable. Print the data from the program with the appropriate messages.

15. Make a program that asks you how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and display your total salary for that month, knowing that 11% is deducted for John, 8% for Andrew and 5% for Alice, make a program that gives us:

    a. gross salary;

    b. how much you paid John;

    c. how much you paid Alice;

    d. the net salary;

    e. calculate the deductions and the net salary, according to the table below:

    | Description | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | + Gross Salary | US$ |
    | - John (11%) | US$ |
    | - Andrew (8%) | US$ |
    | - Alice (5%) | US$ |
    | = Net Salary | US$ |


15. Make a program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 3 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18-liter cans, which cost US$ 80.00. Tell the user the number of cans of paint to buy and the total price.

16. Make a program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18-liter cans, which cost US$ 80.00 or in 3.6-liter gallons, which cost US$ 25.00.
Tell the user the quantities of paint to buy and the respective prices in 3 situations:

    a. buy only 18-liter cans;

    b. buying only 3.6 liter gallons;

    c. mixing cans and gallons so that less paint is wasted. Add 10% leeway and always round the figures up, consider full cans.

17. Make a program that asks for the size of a file to download (in MB) and the speed of an Internet link (in Mbps), calculates and reports the approximate download time of the file using this link (in minutes).
